## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **btrbk.conf snapshot_dir hardcoded** — `render_btrbk_conf()` used hardcoded `.btrbk-snapshots` for all sources; HDD sources with custom `snapshot_dir` (e.g., `ClaudeCodeProjects/.btrbk-snapshots`) now generate correctly from per-source config
- **Production btrbk_conf path** — Config `btrbk_conf` pointed to old hand-written `/etc/btrbk/btrbk.conf` instead of the generated `/etc/das-backup/btrbk.conf`; backup commands were reading the wrong config
- **GUI table sorting missing** — SearchPanel, Health/Drives, and Health/Growth tables now have `QSortFilterProxyModel` with clickable column headers for sorting
- **Snapshot timeline sort order** — Added ascending/descending date sort toggle button to the SnapshotTimeline panel

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Growth trendline chart** — Health Dashboard growth tab now shows a Qt Charts line graph with per-target used-space trend and dashed capacity ceiling lines
- **Free and ETA columns** — Growth table now includes Free (total - used) and ETA Full (14-point linear regression projection of when disk fills)
- **Qt6 Charts dependency** — GUI now requires `qt6-charts` package for growth visualization
- **Distro package testing** — All packaging recipes (Arch, Debian, Fedora, Flatpak, Snap) are now build-tested on their respective distributions before release
- **KF6 Notifications and StatusNotifierItem** — Added missing KF6 dependencies to all packaging formats (required by GUI for desktop notifications and system tray)

### Changed
- **History "Sent" column** — Replaced wide "Bytes Sent" column (formatted byte sizes) with narrow binary "Sent" indicator: Yes (green icon) if data was sent, No (red icon) if backup failed, dash for dry-run/snapshot-only runs

### Fixed
- **Config version stuck at old value** — `setup --upgrade` now auto-updates the `version` field in `/etc/das-backup/config.toml` to match the installed binary version (was stuck at 0.6.0 through multiple releases)
- **Incremental indexing `snapshots_skipped` always 0** — `discover_snapshots()` filtered out already-indexed snapshots before returning, making `walk()` unable to count skipped snapshots; added `DiscoveryResult` struct with both new snapshots and total-on-disk count
- **Growth data missing total_bytes** — D-Bus helper growth JSON now includes `total_bytes` per entry (looked up from target health data) enabling Free/ETA calculations

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **`--uninstall-all` mode** (`btrdasd setup --uninstall-all`) — Removes all installed files: generated configs (same as `--uninstall`), plus cmake-installed binaries, FFI library, D-Bus configs, polkit policy, systemd units, man page, shell completions, desktop entry, and icon
- **Auto-enable helper service** — `cmake --install` now runs `systemctl daemon-reload` and `systemctl enable btrdasd-helper.service` automatically

### Changed
- **GUI version from CMake** — `KAboutData` version in `gui/src/main.cpp` now uses `BTRDASD_VERSION` compile definition from `CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION` instead of a hardcoded string; version stays in sync automatically across releases

### Fixed
- **GUI About dialog showed v0.6.0** — `KAboutData` had a hardcoded `"0.6.0"` version string that was never updated; now derived from CMake project version
- **Stale v0.6.0 binaries in `/usr/local/bin/`** — Manual install from earlier release left binaries in `/usr/local/bin/` that shadowed the cmake-installed `/usr/bin/` binaries due to PATH priority; removed and replaced with symlinks to canonical install locations
- **CMake ExternalProject stale build cache** — `cmake --build` didn't always rebuild Rust binaries when only `cargo build --release` had been run (different `--target-dir`); `build/cargo-target/` vs `indexer/target/release/` divergence caused installed binary to lag behind
- **Indexer UNIQUE constraint** — Resolved duplicate snapshot insertion errors during incremental indexing
- **bytes_sent measurement** — Added `statvfs(2)` disk usage delta measurement for btrbk v0.32 (which doesn't report transfer sizes)
- **7 interconnected GUI + backend bugs** — Resolved issues across D-Bus client, backup panel, health dashboard, and file browser
- **btrbk output parsing** — Corrected parsing of btrbk stdout for backup history recording
- **btrbk filter arguments** — Stopped passing target mount paths as btrbk filter arguments

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Installation instructions** — README and INSTALL.md "Recommended" install only ran `cargo build`, skipping GUI, D-Bus helper, FFI library, scripts, systemd units, polkit, and man page; changed to full `cmake` build path that installs all components by default
- **BUILD_FFI default** — INSTALL.md documented `BUILD_FFI` as `OFF` when CMakeLists.txt has it `ON`; corrected documentation
- **Module count** — Library has 13 public modules (not 12); `ffi` module was missing from counts in README, ARCHITECTURE.md, and CHANGELOG

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Source volume auto-mount** (`mount::ensure_sources_mounted`) — Mounts top-level BTRFS volumes (`subvolid=5`) before btrbk operations so snapshots can access `/@`, `/@opt`, `/@home` etc.; deduplicates shared volumes, creates snapshot dirs and target subdirs; returns `MountGuard` for RAII cleanup
- **Auto-mount/unmount** (`mount.rs`) — RAII `MountGuard` resolves target serials via `/dev/disk/by-id`, mounts BTRFS partitions before operations, unmounts on completion or panic; all D-Bus methods and CLI commands that access targets now auto-mount
- **D-Bus index read methods** — `IndexStats`, `IndexListSnapshots`, `IndexListFiles` (paginated), `IndexSearch`, `IndexBackupHistory`, `IndexSnapshotPath` for read-only index access from the GUI
- **Paginated `IndexListFiles`** — Accepts `limit`/`offset` parameters, returns JSON with `{files, total, limit, offset}` to handle snapshots with millions of files without D-Bus excess-data errors
- **`org.dasbackup.config.read` polkit action** — `allow_active: yes` for read-only config/schedule queries, prevents synchronous D-Bus deadlock when GUI requests config without admin auth dialog
- **`org.dasbackup.index.read` polkit action** — `allow_active: yes` for GUI read-only index access
- **USB SMART passthrough** — Health queries use `-d sat` for USB-attached drives to read SMART data through USB-SATA bridges
- **Growth log history in `HealthQuery`** — Parses `/var/lib/das-backup/growth.log` and includes growth history in health JSON response
- **Service status in `HealthQuery`** — Checks systemd timer/service status and includes in health JSON
- **`db::get_files_in_snapshot_paged()`** — Paginated file listing with `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` and `ORDER BY path`
- **`db::count_files_in_snapshot()`** — Efficient file count using `COUNT(DISTINCT f.id)` for pagination total
- **`FileModel::loadMore()`** — Incremental page loading in the GUI with `beginInsertRows`/`endInsertRows`

### Changed
- **Library modules** — 11 → 13 public modules (added `ffi`, `mount`)
- **Polkit policy** — 5 → 7 actions (added `config.read`, `index.read`)
- **D-Bus methods** — 17 → 23 (added 6 index read methods)
- **`ConfigGet`/`ScheduleGet` polkit** — Changed from `org.dasbackup.config` (auth_admin_keep) to `org.dasbackup.config.read` (allow_active) to prevent Qt event-loop deadlock
- **GUI architecture** — Removed direct `Database` class, rewired all models through `DBusClient`; `IndexRunner` converted from `QProcess` to D-Bus `IndexWalk`
- **Rust test count** — 62 → 161 (133 lib + 19 setup + 9 integration)

### Fixed
- **Source volumes not mounted for btrbk** — Full backup produced only 1 snapshot because `/.btrfs-nvme`, `/.btrfs-ssd`, `/.btrfs-hdd` were not mounted with `subvolid=5`; only `/dasRaid0` (pre-mounted) was accessible to btrbk
- **btrbk command construction** — `create_snapshots()` placed "snapshot" subcommand inside the source loop, producing `btrbk snapshot vol1 snapshot vol2` instead of `btrbk snapshot vol1 vol2`; fixed by moving `cmd.arg("snapshot")` before the loop
- **Volume deduplication** — Multiple sources sharing the same BTRFS volume (e.g., `hdd-projects` and `hdd-audiobooks` both on `/.btrfs-hdd`) caused duplicate btrbk arguments; fixed with `HashSet` deduplication in both `create_snapshots()` and `send_snapshots()`
- **Indexer UNIQUE constraint** — `INSERT INTO snapshots` failed on re-index when snapshot already existed; fixed with `INSERT OR IGNORE`
- **bytes_sent measurement** — Added `statvfs(2)` disk usage delta measurement since btrbk v0.32 doesn't report transfer sizes
- **BackupPanel TOML parser** — Removed `SourceEntry`/`SourceSubvol` struct handling that didn't match actual `config.toml` format; simplified to extract source/target labels only
- **Growth log ISO timestamp parser** — Fixed parsing of ISO 8601 timestamps in growth log
- **Multi-target re-index** — Fixed index walk to handle multiple targets correctly
- **JobProgress D-Bus signal** — Changed `percent` from `u8` to `i32` to match Qt D-Bus signal type
- **HealthQuery JSON key** — Changed GUI JSON key from `drives` to `targets` to match helper response

- **Implementation plan** (`docs/plans/2026-02-24-full-management-implementation-plan.md`) — 41-task phased plan across 5 phases

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Config-driven pipeline** (`btrdasd config dump-env`) — Reads `config.toml` and prints shell-sourceable `DAS_*` key=value pairs; scripts source config at runtime via `eval`
- **Config subcommands** — `btrdasd config dump-env`, `btrdasd config show`, `btrdasd config validate`

- **Template engine** — Generated backup script replaced with thin `exec` wrapper; production scripts embedded via `include_str!` and copied during install
- **systemd units** — Use production paths (`/usr/local/lib/das-backup/`) and generic DAS detection instead of hardcoded dev paths
- **Documentation** — `STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE-AND-RECOVERY.md`, `DISASTER-RECOVERY-GUIDE.md`, `DAS-BAY-MAPPING.md`, `OFFLINE-BACKUP-PLAN.md` all parameterized with `<your-uuid>` placeholders

### Fixed
- **GUI restore action** — Implemented `Database::snapshotPathById()` and `m_currentSnapshotId` tracking; restore now correctly combines snapshot path with file path for `KIO::copy`

  - `btrdasd setup --uninstall` — Remove all generated files, optionally remove database
  - `btrdasd setup --check` — Validate config, verify files, check dependencies
  - System detection: block devices, BTRFS subvolumes, init system (systemd/sysvinit/OpenRC), package manager
  - Template engine: generates btrbk.conf, systemd/cron units, backup script, email config, ESP hooks
  - TOML-based configuration at `/etc/das-backup/config.toml`
- **Dockerfile** — Multi-stage build (rust:1.93-bookworm builder + debian:bookworm-slim runtime) for headless `btrdasd` CLI

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **ButteredDASD content indexer** (`btrdasd`) — Rust CLI for indexing DAS backup snapshots
  - SQLite FTS5 full-text search across all indexed file paths and names
  - Span-based deduplication: unchanged files across consecutive snapshots stored as single row
  - Incremental indexing: only walks newly-created snapshots
  - 4 CLI subcommands: `walk` (index), `search` (FTS5), `list` (snapshot contents), `info` (stats)
  - WAL journal mode for concurrent read/write
  - Performance indexes on snapshots, files, and spans tables
  - 37 unit tests, zero clippy warnings, cargo audit clean
- Integrated `btrdasd` into `scripts/backup-run.sh` with soft-fail (indexing errors don't abort backup)
- Content indexer status line in email backup reports

### Changed
- Indexer built in Rust (edition 2024) instead of planned C++ for memory safety
- Application named ButteredDASD with CLI binary `btrdasd`
